This talk is all about my journey transforming click-ops based teams to dynamic DevOps engineers.

 1) [PowerShell Logging Cheatsheet](https://goo.gl/QgcTHK)  
 This “*Windows PowerShell Logging Cheat Sheet*” is intended to help you get started setting up basic and necessary PowerShell and command line logging. This list includes some very
common items that should be enabled, configured, gathered and harvested for any
Log Management program. Start with these settings and add to it as you
understand better what is in your logs and what you need.
